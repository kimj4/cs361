Tartarus description notes
Fitness
origFit = # of block edges touching a wall
Max fitness
if fewer than 4 blocks
  maxFit = 2 * num blocks
if 4 or more blocks
  maxFit = 4 + num blocks
now we are trying to minimize fitness
fitness = maxFit - origFit + 1


Tartarus1
  implementation based on terminals + functions in tables 10.1, 10.2

Tartarus2
  terminals: left, right, forward
  functions: if/elif/else with 3 children one of which will be evaluated
  if sensor 0 (empty cell): eval left child
  if sensor 1 (box cell): eval middle child
  if sensor 2 (wall cell): eval right child
  one tree evaluated completely before restarting at root



=== notes for report ===
Description of custom moves
- attempt to navigate to a corner.
  - do by forward x 5, right, forward x5, right (to set up for next)
- snake across the board
  - forward x5
  - right
  - forward
  - right
  - forward x5
  - repeat
- this will do better than random because theoretically, we are pushing all of
  the blocks to two opposing edges of the grid. Then we push all of those to the
  remaining opposing edges. This should attempt to get blocks in the corner
  especially if the grid is sparsely populated.

Increasing the number of allowed steps does not seem to help.
Looking at the simulations, it seems that the dozer performs all of its
operations in the beginning, and does nothing for the rest of the remaining
moves. Since all of the score-changing moves are performed in the first 20 or
so steps, increasing the number steps did not help (when all other settings
were kept at default.)
